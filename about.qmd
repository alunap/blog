A meandering through data science and engineering adventures in Julia, Python, and R.

My name is Alun ap Rhisiart. By background is in zoology; I have a BSc in zoology and a DPhil (the Oxford name for a PhD) in behavioural ecology and evolution theory. My research was around communication, predator-prey behaviour, and spider web building. As part of that I did a lot of work with computers, including building genetic algorithm models of the rules spiders may use to build orb webs. The predator-prey part was filmed for David Attenborough's *The Trials of Life* series, and the genetic algorithm work was presented in Richard Dawkin's book *Climbing Mount Improbable*.

Eventually, after some years post-doc research at the universities of Oxford and Basel I left academia to take a carrier as a software engineer and trainer. I worked for IBM, Computer Science International, Toyota, London Processing Centre, and others. I wrote the first XML course for IBM Learning Services and presented it internationally. I then went on to work for 15 years at JP Morgan Chase on the prime record system for the investment bank. During this time, I worked in Smalltalk, Object Pascal, Objective C, Swift, Ruby, and Python amongst others.

Then I made a final transition (and wish I had done it years earlier) into Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistics, and Data Engineering in the education sector. These days I work in Python, R, Julia, and SQL. I spend a lot of time collating data both from internal sources as well as public sources, and putting it together in Databricks in a Data Vault 2.0 architecture using dbt and Prefect. I build models using scikit-learn, xgboost, and huggingface transformers, as well as statistical models in R, and track experiments using Neptune and MLFlow.

Along the way I have inevitably run into blocks and had to find ways around them. I hope to share some of the solutions here to aid others hitting the same issues, in partial recompense for all the great support I have received over the years.
